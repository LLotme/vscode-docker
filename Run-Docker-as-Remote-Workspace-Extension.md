VS Code extensions run as either a "Workspace" extension (aka in the remote environment) or as a "UI" extension (aka in the local environment). However, many Docker features are not supported when running as a "UI" extension. Instead, a prompt like this will be shown:

Follow these steps to make the Docker extension run in the remote environment:
1. Select the option to switch
1. Reload VS Code
1. Navigate to the "Extensions" view
1. Search for "Docker"
1. Install the extension in the remote environment

And you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

* If you want to work with Docker in the local environment, it's recommended to open up a second instance of VS Code outside your remote environment. We are tracking full support for running as a "UI" extension in [#1260](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/1260).
* If you think the above warning is incorrectly blocking functionality that should work, you can disable it by setting `docker.showRemoteWorkspaceWarning` to `true`.
* You can manually control where the extension is run with the following setting:
    ```json
    "remote.extensionKind": {
        "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker": "workspace"
    }
    ```
