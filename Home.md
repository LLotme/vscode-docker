The Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code. 

# Prerequisites and installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your machine and add it to the system path.

On Linux, you should also [enable Docker CLI for the non-root user account](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) that will be used to run VS Code.

To install the extension, open Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for `docker` to filter results and select Docker extension authored by Microsoft.

# Features

The Docker extension can be used to:

- Examine and modify Docker containers, images, networks and volumes.
- Access frequently-used Docker commands directly from VS Code command palette (e.g. run images, launch container shell, view container logs, spin up and down Docker Compose services, and more).
- Author Docker and Docker Compose files (with completion and linting).
- Generate Docker and Docker Compose files for current workspace.
- Work with container registries (e.g. Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry).
- Deploy images from container registry to Azure App Service.
- Debug services running inside a container (currently supported for .NET- and Node.js-based services).
