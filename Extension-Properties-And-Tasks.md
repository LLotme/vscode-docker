# Docker Tasks

Starting with version version 0.9.0, the Docker extension adds several Visual Studio Code tasks. These tasks can be used to control the behavior of Docker [build](Tasks-Docker-Build.md) and [run](Tasks-Docker-Run.md), and form the basis of container startup for debugging.

The tasks allow for a great deal of configuration. Generally speaking, the ultimate configuration that is used is a combination of universal defaults, platform-specific defaults (e.g. .NET Core and Node.js), and user input. As a rule we respect user input as authoritative anytime it conflicts with defaults, _even if it results in debugging not working_. Our philosophy is that the user knows best.

## Docker Build Task

The `docker-build` task builds Docker images using the Docker command line (CLI). The task can be used by itself, or as part of a chain of tasks to run and/or debug an application within a Docker container.

The most important configuration settings for the `docker-build` task are `dockerBuild` and `platform`:

- The `dockerBuild` object specifies parameters for the Docker build command. Values specified by this object are applied directly to Docker build CLI invocation.
- The `platform` property is a hint that changes how the `docker-build` task determines Docker build defaults.

See [property reference](#build-task-reference) for full list of all task properties.

### Platform Support

While the `docker-build` task can be used to build any Docker image, the extension has explicit support (and simplified configuration) for .NET Core and Node.js. 

#### .NET Core

*Minimal configuration using defaults*

When building .NET Core-based Docker image, one can omit the `platform` property and just set the `netCore` object (`platform` is implicitly set to `netcore` when `netCore` object is present). Note that `appProject` is a required property:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build Node Image",
            "type": "docker-build",
            "netCore": {
                "appProject": "${workspaceFolder}/project.csproj"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

*Platform defaults*

For .NET Core-based images, the `docker-build` task infers the following options:

| Property | Inferred Value |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerBuild.context` | The root workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.dockerfile` | The file `Dockerfile` in the root workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.tag` | The base name of the root workspace folder. |


#### Node.js

*Minimal configuration using defaults*

A Node.js based Docker image with no specific platform options can just set the `platform` property to `node`:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build Node Image",
            "type": "docker-build",
            "platform": "node"
        }
    ]
}
```

*Platform defaults*

For Node.js Docker images, the `docker-build` task infers the following options:

| Property | Inferred Value |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerBuild.context` | The same directory in which the `package.json` resides. |
| `dockerBuild.dockerfile` | The file `Dockerfile` in the same directory as the `package.json` resides. |
| `dockerBuild.tag` | The application's `name` property in `package.json` (if defined), else the base name of the folder in which `package.json` resides. |


### Build Task Reference

| --- | --- | --- |
| `package` | The path to the `package.json` file associated with the Dockerfile and `docker-build` task. | The file `package.json` in the root workspace folder. |


## Docker Run Task

The `docker-run` task runs (i.e. creates/starts) a Docker container using the Docker command line (CLI). The task can be used by itself, or as part of a chain of tasks to debug an application within a Docker container.

The most important configuration settings for the `docker-run` task are `dockerRun` and `platform`:

- The `dockerRun` object specifies parameters for the Docker run command. Values specified by this object are applied directly to Docker run CLI invocation.
- The `platform` property is a hint that changes how the `docker-run` task determines Docker run defaults.

See [property reference](#run-task-reference) for full list of all task properties.

### Platform Support

While the `docker-run` task can be used to run any Docker image, the extension has explicit support (and simplified configuration) for .NET Core and Node.js. 

#### .NET Core

When building .NET Core-based Docker image, one can omit the `platform` property and just set the `netCore` object (`platform` is implicitly set to `netcore` when `netCore` object is present). Note that `appProject` is a required property:

```json
{
