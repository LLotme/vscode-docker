# Debugging .NET Core within Docker containers

## Prerequisites

1. Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) which includes support for attaching to the .NET Core debugger.

1. Install the [C# VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) which includes support for attaching to the .NET Core debugger in VS Code.

1. Mac users only: add `/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder` as a shared folder in your Docker preferences.
